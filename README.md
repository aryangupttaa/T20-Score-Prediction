T20 World Cup Score Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict scores for T20 World Cup matches using machine learning. By analyzing historical cricket data, this model provides score predictions that can assist in making strategic decisions for teams, analysts, and enthusiasts. The project is based on a previous model used for IPL win predictions, with modifications tailored to predict T20 World Cup match scores.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and structures raw cricket data to ensure accuracy in predictions.
Training and Testing Models: Splits data for model training and testing to optimize prediction accuracy.
Random Forest Classifier: Utilizes this machine learning algorithm to predict match scores based on historical trends.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface to input match data and receive score predictions.
Decision Support: Provides score predictions that can guide decisions for teams and the cricket council.
Project Workflow
Dataset Collection: Historical data of T20 World Cup matches is collected and formatted.
Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and features are engineered to prepare for modeling.
Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset to recognize patterns and improve predictive accuracy.
Model Testing: The trained model is tested with separate data to validate performance.
Prediction: Given specific input details (e.g., team composition, venue, weather conditions), the model predicts potential match scores.
Decision-Making Support: The predictions are displayed in a user-friendly way to assist cricket analysts and enthusiasts in understanding potential match outcomes.
Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and machine learning model development.
Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier for score prediction.
Data Science Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training.
Flask: (Optional) for building a web interface to access predictions.
Future Enhancements
Incorporate More Complex Models: Explore other machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
Additional Input Features: Include more factors like team form, individual player stats, etc.
Enhanced UI: A more interactive web interface to make the tool accessible for non-technical users.
